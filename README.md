A simple framework for building beautiful documentation sites with Svelte quickly and efficiently. Built primarily for personal projects, DocSmith aims to provide a streamlined documentation experience without unnecessary complexity. Components are based on [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/) and themes are provided by [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/) for a polished, modern look out of the box.
